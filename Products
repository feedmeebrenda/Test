### 2 CUSTOMER CHALLENGE

- **Supermarkets:** Unsure of why the consumers are NOT buying certain products, or NOT visiting a certain store as based on their behaviours within the meal planner.
Case study: missing out market segments: The IGA in X suburb is missing out on customers who would pay for high quality meat. As the customers are unable to find quality meat from this IGA, they had to go to the butcher down the road. 
- **Product manufacturer:** Lack of efficiency in the research/surveying process; slow product to market; don't understand consumers and what they like
- **Restaurant chains:** No evidence based ways to bundle their meals to maximise up-sell and purchases

### 3 OUR VALUE

Core elements of your solution that make it unique and differentiated.

**UNDERSTANDING THE WHY**

Purchase history may provide what the consumers are buying, but Feedmee can provide insight into why they are buying those products. 

**SMARTER & FASTER**

Using artificial intelligence and reinforcement learning, Feedmee is constantly learning and correcting the information it just collects about the users. Tastes and trends are constantly changing, so we need better tech to keep up.

**SAVE MONEY**

Conducting focus groups, hiring mystery shoppers or contracting a consultancy firm cost a lot of money and can create biased and misleading conclusions. Feedmee's solution is aiming to provide a cheaper and more efficient increase in sample size.

**BETTER EFFICIENCY**

No more waiting around for the survey to be conducted and analysed. Feedmee's solution is in real time with larger sample size.
